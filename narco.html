            <h5 style="color: black;" class="card-title">NARCO Review
            </h5>
            <p style="color: black;" class="card-text">I've only watched the first series of Narcos, but I know enough to know that it is a crime show: it features things like police work, with the DEA protagonists capturing Pablo Escobar's lieutenants, finding evidence, etc. Narcos: Rise of the
                Cartels contains almost none of this, and instead tries to tell the story of the Medellin Cartel exclusively through XCOM style turn based tactical combat. It makes the war on drugs a literal war. Let's talk about the elephant in the room
                here: this is a fucked up way to depict police work. In the very first scene of the tutorial, the game asks the player to "bring a gang member in". This involves shooting him repeatedly because this is the only interaction that is available
                to you (until you unlock grenades). Occasionally missions will have objectives like "obtain some evidence" or "rescue a hostage", but just as often it's "assassinate a cartel leader". Narcos the TV show was clearly trying to acknowledge
                the amoral tactics employed by the police, but Narcos the game only really does so via the fact that it contains clips from the show. The fact that you've gunned downed hundreds of people in the street over the course of the game is barely
                commented on. This is the peril of a 'real world' setting, it invites real world questions. (Image credit: Curve Digital) I'm not against depicting the drug war in a strategy game, but Rise of the Cartels doesn't really intersperse the
                combat sections with anything but cutscenes and levelling up your troops. It would help if there were some kind of strategy layer between missions showing the police doing actual police work (or the cartels expanding their influence),
                but even then there would probably be an extraordinary amount of bloodshed even for 1980s Columbia. As it is the most interesting parts of Narcos the show—Escobar's attempt at a political career or the wild card element of militant communists
                M-19—just don't fit within the game's narrow framework. Playing as the Narcos makes things less morally fraught, as you are at least aware that you are definitely the bad guys, however the two campaigns are very similar. Both sides use
                reskinned versions of the same units, just joined together by different cutscenes and story missions. The showcase change from the standard turn-based tactics formula is when the game quickly breaks into manually aimed modes for overwatch—called
                "counteract"—or 'kill shots', which offers a random chance to finish off an enemy on low health. While I can see the logic for adding them, they aren't really satisfying enough for anyone who actually wants a reaction shooter experience,
                and are far too intrusive for someone who wants hands-off strategy gaming. The most satisfying interactions are the comboing of various moves, which gives nearby allies extra movement, extra actions or extra overwatch shots. It was fun
                to build a cop/lookout unit that existed purely to run around and cheer his buddies on.
