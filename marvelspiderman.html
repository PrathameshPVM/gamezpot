        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 style="color: black;" class="card-title">Marvel Spider-Man Review</h5>
            <p style="color: black;" class="card-text">Usually, in a MOBA, you can expect a slow-mid pace to gameplay. There is strategy and leveling up to play your role and tend to your lane effectively. Matches in League of Legends can run a TV block if needed. Mobile Legends is like League
                on crack. Maps are smaller—because it’s mobile—role and gameplay are simplified, and a match can last as long as 20-30 minutes. That isn’t to say that there’s no strategy in Bang Bang and that everyone just gets in and throws down slashing
                and blasting. Strategies are just sped up because you have to be ready to throw down as well. Trust me, it happens often in this game. Moonton isn’t at fault here. As a mobile game, Mobile Legends is exquisite. Your fellow players will
                throw a plan and momentum off by taking lanes with characters who aren’t built for that kind of action at all. It never fails! Also, expect other players to either avoid doing mid lane after you picked any other role or pick the role you
                already claimed close to the last minute. It’s infuriating! However, it can make for a fun game if you’re playing Classic (casual). If you’re doing Ranked, I recommend playing with buddies so that you have a coordinated team that will
                do what they’re supposed to. As we all know, the above shenanigans just aren’t acceptable in Ranked but you can jam out in Classic. It’s all good! The characters you can select are somewhat different from those in other MOBAs. Actually,
                I feel the characters available are pretty much universal across the genre only some names will be changed. Also, ML is pretty generous with rewards. If you play regularly, you will progress and improve. If the game has a flaw it’s that
                the roamer role isn’t very well defined. There’s an in-game explanation of what the role does it’s not explained that well. As a result, you’ll be in a lot of games where your team doesn’t have a roamer at all. By late game, the roles
                might start to fall apart anyway so you might not even notice that the roamer isn’t in play. Teammates will start to jump lanes to help or clean up or even push favorable lanes. From there, things spiral into this lit kill for kill street
                fight. Mobile Gaming Verdict: 9.75/10 Mobile Legends has to be one of the very best mobile games I’ve played! Its fast pace and exciting action kept me want to play another match and another. This isn’t a brief break friendly game. If
                you are in a match, that match is a priority until it ends and you’re putting in all of your thumb reflexes and strategy to push lanes or farm. Bang Bang brings out your aggression as the need to push the lanes becomes more important or
                when teams notice the weakest player and start to exploit them. The game has a thimbleful of minor flaws but if you’re a newcomer to MOBAs like me or a veteran, Mobile Legends is a welcoming game. On that note, if you wanna throw hands
                in ML feel free to add me under MetalSwift!
