                that the game is officially launched, there are certain differences between Battlegrounds Mobile India and the global edition of PUBG Mobile. Let's have a look and decide if it is any better (or worse) than its global counterpart. 873
                Views14 Jul 2021, 03:25 PM Kajol Aikat The Indian gaming community has been waiting for PUBG Mobile to return to the nation, and it has, but under the name "Battlegrounds Mobile India" (BGMI). While the name may lead people to believe
                that the core gameplay of PUBG Mobile has been altered, this is not the case. I'd want to assure you that the gameplay has not changed significantly. Now that the game is officially launched on Android with its first super-season (Season
                20/ C1S1), there are certain differences between Battlegrounds Mobile India and the global edition of PUBG Mobile. Let's have a look and decide if it is any better (or worse) than its global counterpart: PUBGM vs BGMI Prize Hackathon by
                Microsoft Corporation India Pvt. Ltd. Video compression KNOW MORE PUBG Mobile's gameplay and core concepts are carried over to Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI). While the fundamental premise remains the same, BGMI has undergone some changes.
                Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) has undergone significant alterations in order to fit the Indian market: 1. Kills are now Finishes Since the advent of modern video games, shooting down or killing opponents and other targets has always
                been an integral part of an FPS game. In order to keep the game sanitised for, under 18 audiences, Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) will now refer to the act of downing foes as "Finishes." Many PUBG Mobile enthusiasts may miss the thrill
                of a "kill," despite the fact that it carries a sense of completeness. Thus, the K/D ratio (Kill to Defeat ratio) automatically becomes the F/D ratio (Finish to Defeat ratio). 2.Gameplay management for minors In Battlegrounds Mobile India,
                underage players (those under the age of 18) will experience several limitations. They would be permitted three hours every day to play the game. They'll also need permission from their parents or guardians to do so. A daily restriction
                of INR 7000 has also been set for in-game purchased services. Users of PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, are not subject to such limitations. 3. Statutory warning At the start of each game in the spawn island broadcast, players are warned
                about their impression of reality and that the video game they're playing is just that: a game. The game audio says, “This game is a simulation in a virtual world and does not represent the real world. Please play in moderation and take
                frequent breaks.” There is no such initiation in the PUBG Mobile. Players on BGMI, however, can opt to switch off the spawn island broadcast from their settings to turn off the warning note. 4. Server change BGMI onboards users on the
                India server while PUBGM onboards users on its global server, by default. In BGMI, if gamers are unhappy with their current server, Battlegrounds Mobile India will allow them to switch servers. Players can do so by visiting their Settings
                page and choosing from a variety of alternatives. However, this functionality is tentative and is announced to be included in the later versions of the game. 5. Exclusive events Battlegrounds Mobile India will have exclusive costumes and
                events tailored to the interests of local consumers. The company will engage with its partners to bring in fresh material on a regular basis, according to Krafton's announcement. The South Korean company is working on a number of in-game
                events and features, including limited-edition outfits, to commemorate the game's premiere. 6. Kill effect turns green/ yellow with a leaf animation In short, no red blood on the gameplay. The kill-effect has been tweaked to a leaf-burst
                animation and comes in either green or yellow depending on the user's settings preference. While on PUBGM, the kill-effect also carries red and the animation is blood-burst. 7. Season merge One better part of BGMi includes syncing of season
                flow with its global counterpart, which means, BGMI players will play the same season that ongoing in its global avatar. 8. Migration BGMI does provide user profile migration from PUBGM upon first sign up on the game. However, it fails
                to migrate friend lists and clans from PUBGM. Only inventory, UC, and ongoing season rankings are being migrated. Pros: The gameplay is as good as PUBGM Battle Royale engagement is good Graphics is as good as PUBGM Local mediations allow
                better esports opportunities Attempts to establish a healthy gameplay behaviour especially for minors Cons: Ping fluctuates a lot in spite of default onboarding on a smaller server Users fail to interact with their global competitors Customer
                support lacks transparency or interaction in spite of being localised Conclusion BGMI is just as good as the PUBGM. Yes, there are a few changes in terms of visual and graphics outlay, the compromises are far less than what users are offered
                in the new version of the famous battle royale game. Moreover, the game feels more local and native due to the mods introduced in the gameplay. The introduction of BGMI also opens plenty of e-sports opportunities for Indian players. The
                only downside is the ping management which seems quite fluctuating in its early versions. From us, the game wins a straight rating of 4.5 out of 5. Have the chicken dinner now!
