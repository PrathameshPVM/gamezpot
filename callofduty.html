            <h5 style="color: black;" class="card-title">Call of Duty: Mobile - Review
            </h5>
            <p style="color: black;" class="card-text">The Call of Duty franchise is no stranger to mobile gaming. In years past I have fought Call of Duty zombies on a phone, and even used a Nintendo DS stylus to aim down the sights (I don’t recommend it) in similarly scaled-down and unambitious
                games designed for the limitations of those platforms. But the succinctly titled Call of Duty: Mobile is different. It represents a concerted effort from Activision to make a mark on the notoriously difficult-to-crack and overcrowded mobile
                market that now includes the likes of Fortnite and PUBG, and it wants to bring in people for the long term. You won’t find a campaign, but the multiplayer modes are substantial and even include a full battle royale. What’s put forth is
                impressive, though the controls are iffy and the free-to-play microtransactions are a dark cloud on the horizon. As a caveat, using a touch screen to control a shooter will never be on par with a controller, much less a keyboard and mouse,
                and you simply cannot avoid that. Aside from the inherent relative lack of speed and precision, you’re also covering up part of the screen with your digits. With those understandings in place, however, I can say I have been having a decent
                time moving and firing a gun in Call of Duty: Mobile. Movement can be somewhat inconsistent with the virtual left control stick, but aiming and firing feels generally okay. Sneaking up on someone and lining up the reticle works, and in
                the reverse scenario I was able to get my gun up and firing quickly and in a satisfying way. More detailed movement, like vaulting through a window, crouching behind cover, and tossing off a grenade are trickier, thanks to the density
                of on-screen icons, but standard shooting is satisfying. It exceeded my admittedly low expectations. Arguably the biggest barrier to comfortably controlling your soldier is the amount of on-screen icons. There are 20 buttons hovering around
                at all time in standard multiplayer (not including the virtual control sticks), and even more in battle royale. It makes the interface ugly, busy, and hard to get a handle on, but I also don’t think there is a better way when using a controller
                isn’t an option. And bizarrely, it’s not: despite both Android and iOS both now being capable of using standard Bluetooth controllers (like PS4 controllers or a recent Xbox One S or X controller), neither version of Call of Duty: Mobile
                officially offers support, which is just confusing. Looking past the sea of icons, though, Call of Duty: Mobile looks great, relatively speaking. The environments, guns, and soldiers are all full of detail. It naturally doesn’t hold up
                placed side-by-side with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 running on an Xbox One X, but it is impressively close on my iPhone XR.
