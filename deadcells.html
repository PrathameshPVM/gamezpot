            <h5 style="color: black;" class="card-title">Dead Cells Review: There's no rest for the wicked.
            </h5>
            <p style="color: black;" class="card-text">Dead Cells’ movement and combat encourages you to put it all on the line to get a little farther. It’s meant to be replayed dozens of times, unlocking another small but significant fragment of the broad skillset with each new artifact you
                earn. Once you’ve unlocked all of the clever Metroid-style abilities you’re eventually able to move unrestricted through Dead Cells’ darkest recesses to uncover its skimpy, but fun, bits of story and cleverly hidden game references in
                secret areas. There’s a genuine sense that the secrets hiding near the end of Dead Cells’ journey are as potent as those you’re able to unlock near the start. Finding a rune in the acidic pits of the Toxic Sewers changed my first 15 minutes
                of every run thereafter. I now had access to hefty portion of new equipment, secret areas, and alternate routes that were once unreachable. There was almost a rush in dying because it meant I could dive back into the opening minutes to
                uncover something I previously couldn’t. That feeling carries over with each new artifact, and especially after discovering what’s on the other side of the final boss. Improv, Improve The real diversity in each run comes from an excellent
                set of choices in how you want the second-to-second gameplay to work. Perhaps you’ll blitzkrieg through with speed and fire and sword — you’ll be rewarded for your reckless pace with access to timed locking gates that only open if you
                reach them in their stingily allotted times. Or maybe you’ll go through Dead Cells methodically, using ranged weapons, traps, and turrets to safely pierce, poison, burn, or butcher enemies and thoroughly explore every inch of each level
                for treasure. You’ll be stronger for it. I love that in Dead Cells you are free to experiment, but you don’t quite know how it will all shake out. It keeps you improvising. “ These playstyles are changeable on the fly, too, thanks to Dead
                Cells’ smart system for powering up throughout a run by collecting Scrolls of Power. In the beginning, you’re weak, and fragile, but as you collect these scrolls you’ll be able to choose a build based on your style and items. The catch
                is that building an aspect buffs its associated weapons and skills and it’s also how you increase your maximum health pool. The more scrolls you dump into a specific aspect, the less overall health you get for each consecutive one, so
                if you want to play a headless beefcake capable of taking a blow, it’s wise to spread your points out. However, doing so means you’re not particularly powerful with any one set of items, so your damage likely won’t be enough to whittle
                down the ever-inflating enemies in the later levels. I love that in Dead Cells you are free to experiment, but you don’t quite know how it will all shake out. Your starting weapons, the items you pick up, and their modifiers are always
                different. It keeps you improvising.
