        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 style="color: black;" class="card-title">Riot Games has stayed in its lane for a long time. Keeping to itself, building League of Legends with a dabble in Teamfight Tactics, the nonetheless vast and wealthy studio rarely bothered itself with the outside world – that was until last
                year.
            </h5>
            <p style="color: black;" class="card-text">Riot dipped a toe in the world of CCGs with Legends of Runeterra and announced a planned cannonball into the pool of competitive FPS with Project A – a code name for the game we now know as Valorant. Valorant is best described through games
                that existed before it. By mixing the competitive formula of Counter-Strike with the characters of Overwatch, Valorant is cribbing from two of the most successful games in this space. There was little doubt in my mind that the game was
                going to be at least good – and perhaps great. Valorant is an FPS hero shooter, and like many top tier triple-A games these days, each hero you play commands different abilities, displays different personalities, and boasts a distinct
                visual style – in other words, they’re true characters. Each ‘agent’ has the same choice of guns as any other – an important distinction from Overwatch – but with extra smokes, grenades, or other tactical equipment that are unique to them.
                These abilities are far more straightforward to learn than in Overwatch. Omen, Jett, Brimstone, Cypher, and Viper all have some form of smokes, for example orbs of wisps (or a circle of static for Cypher). Their colours, methods of distribution,
                and secondary effects may differ a little, but their primary function is the same: blocking enemy vision so that you can move more freely, perhaps setting up a flank or establishing control over an area. Other shared abilities include
                Phoenix and Viper being able to deploy smoke in a line, while Phoenix, Brimstone, and Viper all command similar abilities to spread damage over an area, like CS:GO’s molotovs. There are some truly unique abilities to each agent – ultimates
                being the best example – but it’ll take you a lot less time to get a feel for the general playing field in Valorant than in Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch, or even Amazon’s new contender, Crucible.
